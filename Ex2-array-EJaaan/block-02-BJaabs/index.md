## Practice Array

- Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using `console.log()`

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Now do the same with the third color in the list.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Re-assign the value of the last color in array to "ultraviolet".

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Re-assign the value of the last color in array to "ultraviolet". This time use `arr.length` property to know the length of the array.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add another color to the end of the list. (use array method called push)

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add another color to the beginning of the list. (use unshift)

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Print the length of the array to the console with `console.log()`

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.(use for loop)

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.(use for..in)

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Write another loop to display the value and key of array in this format. `The value for index 0 is Red` for each value.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Create a variable named `lastColor` that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add a new color `tomato` to the index 45. And check the length of the array. Use `console.log` to print.

```js
// your code goes here
```
