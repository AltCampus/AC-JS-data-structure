## BLOCK-writeCode

### Follow instructions below and write code accordingly.

- Create a variable named `character` using `let` assign a value of empty object.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Go to this [Arya Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark)

Re-assign the value of `charator` variable to and object with the key `charatorName` and value of the first name of your charactor i.e "Arya"

```js
// your code goes here
```

- A variable named `age` is predefined with value 20. Add a new key named `character-age` with the value of `age` variable i.e 20.

```js
let age = 20;
// your code goes here
```

- Add a new key `sur name` with the value of the surname of the cahractor i.e "Stark". (Don't remove the space between `sur` and `name`)

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add a new key `title` with the value title of the charactor (you will find in the right side bar) i.e "Lady of Winterfell"

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add another property named `greet` and value should be a function when called should alert `I am [NAME HERE] and my title is [TITLE HERE]`.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add a new property named `isFemale` and value will either be `true` or `false` according to the charactor.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Change the method `greet` to now alert `He am [NAME HERE] and his title is [TITLE HERE]` if the character is male or else `She is [NAME HERE] and her title is [TITLE HERE]`. You should use `if/else`.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Add a new method (function inside objects are called methods) named `changeGender`. When called should be able to flip the value of `isFemale` from true to false and false to true.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Check by accessing `greet` and see if the message changed or not.

```js
// your code goes here
```

Add a new key with the value stored in `keyName` variable i.e (`playedBy`) and the value of the `playedBy` you will find in right side bar. (use `[]` instead of `.` operator)

```js
let keyName = "playedBy";
// your code goes here
```

- Using `alert` alert the value stored in key `playedBy`.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Write a `for..in` loop to `console.log()` all the key of the object `character`.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Write a `for..in` loop to log the all the key and value pair seperated by `-` like `charactorName - Arya`.

```js
// your code goes here
```

- Using the function `console.log` log the value of the key `42`. You don't have to add the key.

```js
// your code goes here
```
